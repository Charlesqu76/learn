# JavaScript Prototype: A Complete Guide
> For a give object o, the object from which oinherits proporities is called the o's prototype

In JavaScript, **prototypes** are a fundamental part of how inheritance and object properties work. Every JavaScript object is linked to another object, known as its **prototype**, from which it can inherit properties and methods.

----------

## 1. What is a Prototype?

-   A **prototype** is an object that is associated with every JavaScript function and object by default.
-   When you create an object, JavaScript automatically assigns it a prototype.
-   If a property or method is not found on the object itself, JavaScript looks for it in the prototype chain.

### Key Concept:

```
const obj = {};
console.log(obj.toString());  // Inherited from Object.prototype`
``` 

-   `obj` doesnâ€™t have a `toString` method, but it inherits it from `Object.prototype`.
----------

## 2. Prototype Chain

-   JavaScript objects are linked through a chain called the **prototype chain**.
-   If an object does not have a property, JavaScript checks the prototype, and if it's not there, it checks the next prototype, continuing up the chain.
-   The chain ends with `null` (the prototype of `Object.prototype` is `null`).

### Example:

```
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;
};

const person1 = new Person('John');
console.log(person1.greet());  // Inherited from Person.prototype
``` 

----------

## 3. Creating and Modifying Prototypes

-   You can add methods and properties to the prototype of a constructor function to ensure all instances share them.

### Adding Methods:
```
Person.prototype.sayBye = function() {
  return `${this.name} says goodbye.`;
};

console.log(person1.sayBye());
``` 

### Overriding Prototype Methods:

```
Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  return `Hi! I am ${this.name}.`;
};

console.log(person1.greet());
``` 

----------

## 4. Checking Prototype

-   Use `Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)` to get the prototype of an object.
-   Use `obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)` to check if a property exists directly on the object, not in the prototype chain.
-   Use `prop in obj` to check if a property exists in the object or its prototype chain.

### Example:
```console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(person1));  // Person.prototype
console.log(person1.hasOwnProperty('greet')); // false (inherited)
console.log('greet' in person1);              // true (via prototype)``` 

----------

## 5. `__proto__` and `prototype`

-   `__proto__` is a reference to the prototype of the object.
-   `prototype` is a property of **functions**, not objects.

### Example:

```console.log(person1.__proto__ === Person.prototype);  // true
console.log(Person.prototype.constructor === Person); // true
```

----------

## 6. Prototypal Inheritance

-   Objects can directly inherit from other objects without using classes.
```const animal = {
  eat() {
    console.log('eating...');
  }
};

const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.bark = function() {
  console.log('barking...');
};

dog.eat();  // Inherited from animal
dog.bark();
```
----------

## 7. Modern ES6+ with `class` and Prototypes

-   ES6 introduces the `class` syntax, but under the hood, it still uses prototypes.

``` class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.brand = brand;
  }
  
  drive() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} is driving`);
  }
}

const car1 = new Car('Tesla');
car1.drive();`` 
```
----------

## 8. Key Takeaways

-   **Prototypes enable inheritance** in JavaScript.
-   Every object in JavaScript has a **prototype**.
-   Modifying the prototype affects all instances.
-   **Prototype chaining** allows property lookups through parent objects.
-   ES6 `class` is syntactic sugar over the existing prototype mechanism.
