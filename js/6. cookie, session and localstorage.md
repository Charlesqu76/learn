## Difference Between Cookie, Session Storage, and Local Storage

### 1. Overview

Cookies, Session Storage, and Local Storage are all web storage mechanisms used to store data on the client-side. They each have unique properties and use cases.

### 2. Comparison Table
| Feature | Cookie | Session Storage| Local Storage|
|--|--| -- | -- | --- |
| **Data Storage Duration** |Set by expiration date  |Until the browser/tab is closed | Persist until manually deleted|
|**Storage Limit**|~4KB| ~5-10MB | ~5-10MB | --- |
|**Accessibility**|Sent with every HTTP request| Accessible only via JavaScript | Accessible only via JavaScript | 
|**Security Considerations**|Vulnerable to CSRF/XSS| Less vulnerable (not sent to server) | Less vulnerable (not sent to server) | 
|**Use Case**|Authentication, user tracking | Temporary data (per tab/session) | Persistent data (settings, cache) |
|**Availability Across Tabs**|Yes (same origin)| No | Yes (same origin) | --- |
|**Data Expiry**| Configurable (can be session-based) | Automatically on tab close |No automatic expiration| --- |


















### 3. Key Points

-   **Cookies** are small pieces of data stored by the browser and sent to the server with each HTTP request. They are often used for session management, authentication, and tracking.
-   **Session Storage** stores data only for the duration of a page session. Once the tab or browser is closed, the data is cleared.
-   **Local Storage** stores data with no expiration, making it ideal for long-term storage of less sensitive data that needs to persist across sessions.

### 4. Example Use Cases

-   **Cookies**: Store JWT tokens for authentication.
-   **Session Storage**: Keep temporary form data during navigation.
-   **Local Storage**: Store theme preferences or user-selected language.

### 5. Code Examples

```javascript
// Cookie
// Set Cookie
document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2024 23:59:59 GMT; path=/";

// Session Storage
sessionStorage.setItem("key", "value");
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("key")); // Outputs: value

// Local Storage
localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark");
console.log(localStorage.getItem("theme")); // Outputs: dark

```

### 6. Best Practices

-   Use **Cookies** for small amounts of sensitive data that need to be sent to the server.
-   Use **Session Storage** for temporary data that should not persist beyond the user's session.
-   Use **Local Storage** for persistent data that needs to remain across sessions without server interaction.
